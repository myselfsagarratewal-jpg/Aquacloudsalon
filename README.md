🌊☁️ Aqua Cloud Unisex Salon – A Story of Two Brothers ☁️🌊

Sagar Singh Ratewal and Akash Singh Ratewal – two brothers with one dream, which is now a beautiful reality.

On 30th April 2025, they launched Aqua Cloud Unisex Salon.
Even the name has a special meaning:
Aqua means water – inspired by Sagar,
Cloud means sky – inspired by Akash.

So, Aqua Cloud is not just a name – it’s a blend of both their identities and vision.

Sagar Singh Ratewal comes with strong experience in business and financial markets.
Akash Singh Ratewal brings passion, creativity, and love for styling.
Together, they’ve created a salon where it’s not just about looking good — but feeling confident too.

The salon is now open, and we welcome you to visit and support their journey.
